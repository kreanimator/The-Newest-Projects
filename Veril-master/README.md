### Separate the things.
---
The main goal for this project is to be classy.

There are two main packages, `frontend` and `backend`.

The `frontend` implements the game, using main methods, KeyListeners, and JFrames.

The `backend` has no interest in how the user sees and interacts with the game. It simply calls interfaces and assumes that somehow things are working.

*One day, an android branch shall exist. On this day, I shall pray that this rule is respected.*

### Follow your dreams.

Lets make this thing. 

Use issues and milestones on GitHub to note bugs and suggest features.
